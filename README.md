# Verified Categorical Simulator

A next-generation simulation framework combining **numerical computation**, **category theory**, and **Lean theorem proving**.

---

##  Overview

The `VerifiedCategoricalSimulator` integrates:

- Continuous Lean verification of conservation laws  
- Categorical morphisms representing fluxes  
- Automated theorem proving during simulation execution  
- A knowledge-graph–powered reasoning system  
- Pattern detection, analytics, and visualization  

This project bridges **numerical simulation** with **mathematically verified reasoning**.
